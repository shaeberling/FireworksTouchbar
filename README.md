## How to use

If you don't want to mess with all the files, you can simply [download the latest release of the app here][latest-release]. Launch the app and you're good to go.

### But wait, I don't have the brand new MacbookPro!

You can still enjoy this colorful app by [checking this app][touchbar-launcher].

## Credit where credit is due

As the basis for this I used [Knight TouchBar 2000][knight] by AkdM and modified for my needs. I am very thankful for this groundwork which saved me quite some time to set this up. Check out his Knight Rider scanner app, it's awesome!
